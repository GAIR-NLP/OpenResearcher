<p class="ltx_p">We show evidence of particle acceleration at GEV energies associated directly with protons from the prompt emission of a long-duration M6-class solar flare on July 17, 2023, rather than from protons acceleration by shocks from its associated Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), which erupted with a speed of 1342 km/s. Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) accelerated by the blast have reached Earth, up to an almost S3 (strong) category of a radiation storm on the NOAA scale.
Also, we show a temporal correlation between the fast rising of GOES-16 proton and muon excess at ground level in the count rate of the New-Tupi muon detector at the central SAA region.
A Monte Carlo spectral analysis based on muon excess at New-Tupi is consistent with the acceleration of electrons and protons (ions) up to relativistic energies (GeV energy range) in the impulsive phase of the flare. In addition, we present another two marginal particle excesses (with low confidence) at ground-level detectors in correlation with the solar flare prompt emission.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Since 1950 the observation of solar energetic particles from the solar
flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been done with ground-level experiments, such as the neutron monitors (NMs) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">meye56</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">simp00</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mora00</span>)</cite>
as well as the solar neutron telescope network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">hu22</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">vald09</span>)</cite>, all around the world.
These observations have yielded a lot of new information. For instance, the existence of a prompt and gradual emission of solar energetic particles (SEP) in flares and CMEs, respectively, the correlations of the cosmic ray intensity with CMEs and other solar disturbances crossing the Earth, etc.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">chup87</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">mora00</span>)</cite></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Also, the solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays is inversely correlated with solar activity, inferred through the number of sunspots, which can be the key to understanding more about space weather <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">cade15</span>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Nowadays, particles accelerated to near the Sun can be detected by space-borne instruments such as the High-Energy Proton
and Alpha Detector (HEPAD) on the Geostationary Operations Environmental Satellite (GOES) and the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft at Lagrange L1 point, through the Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (EPAM) and the Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS), among others.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Not all of the solar energetic particles can be measured at ground level. Even those SEPs from solar events with a good geoeffectiveness can be dissipated by the IMF, or deflected or captured by the Earth’s magnetic</p>

<p class="ltx_p">On the other hand, ground-level enhancements (GLEs), typically in the MeV-GeV energy range, are sudden increases in cosmic ray intensities registered in most cases by NMs. GLEs are quite rare events, and fewer than 100 GLEs have been observed by NMs in the last 70 years. In most cases, the NMs that observed GLEs are located at regions with small geomagnetic rigidity cutoff, that is, at high latitudes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">shea12</span>)</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">However, in the present case, despite a radiation storm reaching above the S2-class on the NOAA scale on July 18, 2023, it did not generate a GLE, only a prompt emission of relativistic protons (ions) above GeV energies, during the phase eruptive, and observed by ground-level detectors strategically located, within the SAA central region (New-Tupi muon detector) and by the (Yangbagin muon telescope) at the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory (Tibet 4440 m a.s.l) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">zhan10</span>)</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The New-Tupi muon detector is completely
unmoderated (without no surrounding lead or other material). The muon detection energy threshold is about 200 MeV (see Appendix A). That contrasts with other muon detectors that have, in most cases, a surrounding lead material with a thickness of up to 5 cm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The shielding effect of the Earth’s magnetic field on cosmic ray particles is quantified by the magnetic rigidity cutoff from a specific location <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">smar09</span>)</cite>. The smaller the rigidity cutoff, the lower the energy cosmic ray particles penetrate the magnetosphere.
On the other hand, a restricted area between latitudes 20 and 40 of the southern hemisphere, over South America
and the Atlantic Ocean poses a geomagnetic field
with an anomalously lower intensity (around 22,000
nT). The region is known as the South Atlantic Anomaly
(SAA) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">pavo16</span>)</cite>. According to Swarm’s satellite observations
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">finl20</span>)</cite>, the SAA appears splitting into two, a smaller area
over the Atlantic Ocean in southwest Africa and a larger
area over eastern South America. Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Prompt emission of relativistic protons up to GeV energies from M6.4-class solar flare on July 17, 2023" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (top panel) summarizes
the situation. We would like to point out that
the location of the New-Tupi telescope coincides with the central
part of the SAA indicated by the arrow on the left
of Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Prompt emission of relativistic protons up to GeV energies from M6.4-class solar flare on July 17, 2023" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (top panel).</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The main effect of the SAA is on the satellites since
the ’70s. We know the frequent failures when they pass
through the SAA region. A large amount of charged
particles precipitation in this region damages and perturbates
the satellites’ electronics. Also, according to
the results from the PAMELA detector at satellite’s altitudes
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">caso09</span>)</cite>, the effect of geomagnetic cutoff on low-energy
particles is present in high latitudes close to the poles
and also in the SAA region, composed mostly of low energy
cosmic protons (E <math id="S2.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;" display="inline"><mo>&lt;</mo></math> 200 MeV ). In other words, the
Pamella satellite has shown that the SAA introduces a
sub-cutoff in the magnetic rigidity, below the Stormer’s
magnetic rigidity cutoff.
We show that the SAA also affects secondary cosmic
rays detected at ground level. As the horizontal magnetic
component on Earth’s surface is smaller on the
SAA, the magnetic lateral dispersion of the secondary
particles forming an air shower is smaller too. The effect
increases the number of particles reaching a detector. In
other words, this behavior mimics a magnetic rigidity
sub-cutoff below the Stormer’s rigidity cutoff.
We show that effect through a Monte Carlo simulation
based on CORSIKA-Fluka code <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">heck12</span>; <span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">batt08</span>)</cite>, where <math id="S2.p3.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1.0\times 10^{6}" display="inline"><mrow><mn>1.0</mn><mo lspace="0.222em" rspace="0.222em">×</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>6</mn></msup></mrow></math> proton

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We have reported evidence of SEPs accelerated up to GeV energies during the eruptive phase of the M6-class solar flare on July 17, 2023. The result comes from a timing analysis of a muon excess from the New-Tupi detector at the SAA central region. Muons at New-Tupi are produced by protons (ions) interaction in the upper atmosphere reaching the Earth with a magnetic rigidity above 3 GV (<math id="S5.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><mo>∼</mo></math> 3 GeV for protons).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In most cases, SEP (mostly protons) detected by the GOES-16 spacecraft shows two steps. An impulsive phase, where the acceleration of protons (ions) is by the prompt emission of flare, followed by a gradual phase of long duration, where the acceleration of protons (ions) is by the associated CME shock waves.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We want to point out that the muon excess produced by SEPs with an effective rigidity above the cutoff (<math id="S5.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><mo>∼</mo></math> 3 GV) at the New-Tupi muon detector is in temporal coincidence only with the GOES proton flux from the impulsive phase (see Fig. <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3 Analysis ‣ Prompt emission of relativistic protons up to GeV energies from M6.4-class solar flare on July 17, 2023" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) . Consequently, in the gradual phase, the protons accelerated by CME’s shocks do not reach the GeV energy range because a muon excess is absent at ground level.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A marginal muon excess also appears on the Yan ba Jing S-21(pointing 21 degrees south) muon telescope (in Tibet). Also, a marginal particle excess is seen only in the French Kerguel NM (close to the South polar region).
In both cases, the excesses are in (temporal) coincidence with the GOES proton flux (impulsive phase). However, it is hard to verify whether these excesses are genuine due to low confidence or simply fluctuations in the detectors’ count rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">From a Monte Carlo analysis,
we show that the SAA central region is favourable to the observation of transient solar events, especially SEP, because
the magnetosphere has a ”dip´´ in this region,

<div id="A1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The New-Tupi telescope is built with four identical particle detectors, forming two telescopes, as shown in Fig. 8 from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">augu16a</span></cite>. Each detector consisting of an Eljen EJ-208
plastic scintillator slab of 150 cm x 75 cm x 5 cm and a Hamamatsu R877 photomultiplier of 127
millimeters in diameter, packaged in a pyramidal box.
The PMT high voltage divider, amplifier, and high voltage power supplier are in the ORTEC ScintiPackTM Photomultiplier Base 296.</p>

<div id="A1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">From February 6, 2023, we have implemented a data acquisition system using a VERTILON high-speed pulse counting system (MCPC618-8 Channel). allowing for direct connection with the PMTs without the need for external preamplifiers,
with a 250 MHz count rate per channel.</p>
</div>
<div id="A1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Now the detector is working only in scaler mode or
single particle technique <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(<span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">agli96</span>)</cite>, where the single hit rates of all four PMTs, are recorded once a second.
However, so far, only two detectors are working. The coincidences among these detectors of each telescope will be implanted.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Also, the barometric coefficients for cosmic muon fluxes at the Earth’s surface can be obtained using the CORSICA code in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><span class="ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self">kovy13</span></cite>. For New-Tupi detector conditions and at sea level, the barometric coefficient is about -0.14% per mb, about eight to nine times less than the typical barometric coefficient in NMs.</p>
